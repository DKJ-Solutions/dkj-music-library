> it. No gate in YOUR repo reads a heading, so this half is on you -- only the repo that authors
> this workflow refuses a fifth (Dave, August 26, 2026).

> **AND NOTHING BRANCH-SPECIFIC ABOVE THE FIRST OF THOSE FOUR HEADINGS** -- everything between the
> title and it is this guidance, which is identical in every branch document. A status line, a note about
> THIS branch or an instruction to a session belongs under one of the four, normally as a `####`
> in PLAN. THIS half open-pr refuses, in every repo, before the push -- it reads the shape, so a

> **DEPLOY takes no steps of its own, and it is WRITTEN LAST** -- it is what the branch DID, once
> TEST says so. Written while steps above it are still open it states an INTENTION, and no gate
> holds it against what landed: the step gate splits this file at that heading and counts only
> above it. The PR title is the one exception -- new-branch -Title writes it at creation, because
> open-pr composes the PR title from it. It is the one part of this file that travels verbatim
> into `CHANGELOG.md` at the merge. In each tier, write the reason
> ABOVE the Score line -- anything below it is discarded.
>
> Relative links in that text resolve FROM THIS DIRECTORY -- `CHANGELOG.md` sits here too, so
> write each path exactly as it reads in this file.

> The phase arc, the marks and the whole form: `DEVELOPMENT-portable.md`, which ships

### PLAN

Adopt the shared specialists (`specialists-init`) and the `dkj-policy` workflow (`adopt-dkj-policy`,
parts 1 to 3) in this repo, as one change.

### CREATE

- [x] `specialists-init` bootstrap: persona lenses, specialist lens scaffolds, `SPECIALISTS.md`, seam libs
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` reduced to the two `@`-imports (constitution + specialists)
- [x] Part 1: `dkj-policy/` folder, branch-entry and always-on-budget gates, PR template
- [x] Part 2: the 12 `copy` seam functions placed in `scripts/repo-config.ps1`
- [x] Part 3: fold-on-merge, verify-resolved, repo-settings and merge-on-green runners
- [x] Branch prefix table filled in `scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1`

### TEST

- [x] `check-script-contract.ps1`: 0 errors

### DEPLOY: chore/adopt-dkj-workflow

#### What does the change on this branch deploy to main?

##### Tier 0

The repo now runs the shared specialist team and the dkj-policy branch/PR/fold workflow: every PR
carries a branch document, is gated in CI, and is folded into `dkj-policy/CHANGELOG.md` at the merge.

**Score:** 4

##### Tier 1
