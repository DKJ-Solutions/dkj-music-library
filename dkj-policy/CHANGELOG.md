### DEPLOY: chore/adopt-dkj-workflow · 20260927-071710Z

#### What does the change on this branch deploy to main?

##### Tier 0

The repo now runs the shared specialist team and the dkj-policy branch/PR/fold workflow: every PR
carries a branch document, is gated in CI, and is folded into `dkj-policy/CHANGELOG.md` at the merge. `lint-en-tests` is now a required check on
`main`, and the one test that failed only on Linux CI (the mix-dir override path) is fixed.

##### Tier 1
